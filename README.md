# Sweepstakes_project
Dependency Injection was used in the "MarketingFirm" class, where we use ISweepstakeManager to handle 2 different kinds of data structures. 
This has a benefit because it means we can use two different data structures for one class without changing the logic of the class that depends on the data structure to handle its sweepstake system.
